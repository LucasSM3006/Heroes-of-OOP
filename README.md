# Heroes-of-OOP

Nuffin' special, just a game I made for class.
Do be aware of the following: I was extremely unexperienced with doing anything that required more than a couple of classes, methods and lines of code at the time.
It's a disorganized mess that somehow works (or seems to work), and I really do need to rewrite all of it.
At it's current state, it works, but it's nothing short of a bloody mess.
All the programming sins in a single zip file.
