# Heroes-of-OOP
Simple little game.
Need to rewrite all of it, create more classes and methods to make it be.. Well, not spaghetti.
Currently it's organized like absolute c###, and it has a lot of unnecessary "if else" statements, along with some variables and attributes which are never even used.

I'll do all of that during my free time, I suppose.. But until then, version 1.0 is the current version, it's made to just work, that's all it does.
The defense mechanic might be broken as well, but I don't really have the time nor patience to make it work right now.
